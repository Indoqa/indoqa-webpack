# Indoqa Webpack

## Motivation

[Webpack]() is a low-level build tool for Javascript web applications. In [our](https://indoqa.com) opinion too low-level to be maintained in each of our projects. Since we found out that our webpack configurations are in huge parts identical, we started indoqa-webpack which can be configured delcaratively.

## Goals

The goal of indoqa-webpack is supporting following use cases:

 * create production-ready release artifacts (Javascript, CSS)
 * provide a hot-reloadable development server using [express](http://expressjs.com)
 * support for Javascript libraries and make use of [externals](https://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html)
 * out-of-the-box usage for [Jest]() tests
 * out-of-the-box configuration of [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) using [eslint-config-indoqa](https://github.com/Indoqa/eslint-config-indoqa)
 * hide webpack configurations and provide a declarative configuration
 * simple upgrade path to newer versions of indoqa-webpack
